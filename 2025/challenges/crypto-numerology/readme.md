1. Decompile crypto_numerology.cpython-312.pyc to crypto_numerology.py, by the tool PyLingual (https://pylingual.io)

2. From the decompiled python code, know "known_key_active_material_hex" is "Hex string for the non-zero part of the known key. "

In secrets.env file:
`KNOWN_KEY_ACTIVE_MATERIAL_HEX=5c54700231f4727bf7d49234e7bbb1c9`

3. Find the counter for the secret flag

```shell
> python3 counter_solver.py
...
Found!
current_counter: 32279
```

In secrets.env file:
`SECRET_TARGET_COUNTER_INT=32279`

4. From the decompiled python code, know the flag of length 42 is affected by only the first 42/4 (first 11) states elements, so nonce is unrelated. Choose anyone.

In secrets.env file:
`SECRET_TARGET_NONCE_HEX=000080000000000000000000`

5. Find the remaining characters one by one after "CTF{" until the total length is 42

```shell
python3 bruteforce.py
...
Found!
c: }
```

Flag:
`CTF{w3_aRe_g0Nn@_ge7_MY_FuncKee_monkey_!!}`
