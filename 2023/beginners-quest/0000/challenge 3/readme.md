Transposition ciphers are a type of encryption algorithm that works by rearranging the order of characters in a plaintext message. Unlike substitution ciphers, which replace characters with other characters, transposition ciphers keep all of the original characters intact. The ciphertext is created by rearranging the plaintext letters according to a predetermined rule or key. FLAG{caesar_would_have_liked_these_columns}XXXX
